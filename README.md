How to get started
- Check the Releases page first
  - The latest release package contains a ready-to-run version of the application. It is the easiest way to explore the project without setting up a full dev environment.
  - If you need the codebase, clone the repository and run the project locally.
- If you want to run the project locally, you need Node.js and npm.
- This project is designed so a beginner can contribute. Start with small tasks, then move to larger features.

Downloading and using the releases
- The project ships release assets on the Releases page. To get started, download the latest release archive, extract it, and run the app as described in the release notes.
- The Releases page URL to use is the one shown above. Visit the page to download the correct file and follow the installation steps provided there.
- If the link ever changes or the release page is unavailable, check the Releases section of the repository for the latest assets.

Download and execute guidance for this path
- Since the link includes a path, you should download the release archive from the page and execute the installer or open the extracted index.html in a browser, depending on how the package is prepared.
- Typical steps:
  - Download the archive (for example, calculator-project-latest.zip).
  - Extract the archive to a local folder.
  - Open the index.html file with a browser, or run any included installer if the package contains one.
  - If you see a build step, follow the instructions on the release notes to complete setup.

Getting started locally: step-by-step
- Prerequisites
  - A modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari).
  - Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm.
  - Git is optional but recommended if you plan to contribute.
- Install and run
  - Clone the repository:
    - git clone https://github.com/Pavanakumar777/calculator-project.git
  - Move into the project folder:
    - cd calculator-project
  - Install dependencies:
    - npm install
  - Start the development server:
    - npm run dev
  - Open the app in your browser:
    - The server will usually start at http://localhost:5173
- Alternative for Vue users
  - If you choose to explore a Vue setup, you can explore the Vue components and adapt the project to a Vue environment. The core logic can be shared between vanilla JavaScript and Vue components.

Notes on the Releases link and the download process
- The Releases page hosts the downloadable artifacts. If you do not use the release assets, you can still access the source code and run the project locally via npm scripts.
- If the link or page is not accessible, navigate to the Releases section on the repository page to locate the latest assets and instructions.
- The link is included twice in this document for convenience: once at the very top and again in the Releases section below.

Project structure (a proposed organization)
- index.html: The main HTML file that loads the app. It includes the root element for rendering the calculator UI.
- src/
  - main.js or main.ts: Entry point for the app. Sets up the DOM, event listeners, and mounts components when using vanilla JS or bundles code for frameworks.
  - App.vue (optional): If you are using Vue, this file represents the calculator’s root component.
  - components/ (optional): Self-contained UI pieces such as Button, Display, and Keypad components.
  - styles/:
    - main.css: Global styles for the calculator UI.
    - responsive.css: Styles for different screen sizes and orientations.
  - assets/: Images and icons used by the UI.
- vite.config.js: Build configuration for Vite.
- package.json: Scripts for development, build, and linting.
- README.md: This file, describing the project, how to contribute, and how to run it.

Design and UI guidelines
- Clean, readable typography
  - Use a font stack that looks good on most systems. A common choice is system-ui, Inter, or Roboto.
  - Ensure high contrast between text and background for readability.
- Calculator layout
  - A responsive grid for digits 0–9 and operators.
  - A display area that shows the current input and the result.
  - Clear, Delete, and equals controls that are easy to reach.
- Color palette
  - A light theme with soft shadows to create depth.
  - Accent color for operator buttons to distinguish them from digits.
- Accessibility
  - Keyboard support: users can navigate and press keys with the keyboard.
  - ARIA labels for all controls: each button has an aria-label that describes its function.
  - Focus visibility: clear focus outlines for keyboard users.
- Responsiveness
  - The calculator should adapt to phones, tablets, and desktops.
  - The grid should reflow gracefully to fit narrow screens.

Coding patterns and examples
- DOM manipulation
  - Use event delegation for keypad interactions to reduce the number of event listeners.
  - Update the display by changing the textContent of the display element.
  - Keep the calculation logic separate from the UI to ease testing and future changes.
- Calculator logic (conceptual)
  - Maintain a small state: currentValue, operator, and previousValue.
  - On operand input, build the currentValue string or number.
  - On operator input, move currentValue to previousValue and store the operator.
  - On equals, apply the operator to previousValue and currentValue to produce the result.
- Example snippet (vanilla JS)
  - Note: This is a conceptual snippet to illustrate the approach. The actual project may use a component structure or Vue bindings if you choose to explore Vue.
  - Display update:
    - display.textContent = currentValue;
  - Handling a digit press:
    - currentValue = (currentValue || '') + digit;
- If you opt to use Vue
  - The main state can live in a data object.
  - Bind the display with interpolation: {{ displayValue }}.
  - Use methods to handle key presses and button clicks.
  - Keep the keypad as a reusable component to promote collaboration.

Development workflow and collaboration
- Branching model
  - Use a simple branch model: main for the stable release, develop for ongoing work, and feature/your-name for new features.
- Issue tracking
  - Open issues to propose new features, report bugs, or request improvements.
  - Use clear titles and concise descriptions.
- Pull request guidelines
  - Each PR should have a short description of the change and why it matters.
  - Link related issues when applicable.
  - Include tests or manual test steps if you add functionality.
- Code style and quality
  - Keep functions small and focused.
  - Add comments that explain why a tricky part exists, not what the code already does.
  - Use consistent indentation and naming conventions.
- Testing and verification
  - Run the app locally and perform manual tests for common tasks: entering numbers, using operators, clearing, and obtaining results.
  - If you have automated tests, add a few unit tests for the calculator logic.

Usage examples and walkthroughs
- Basic calculation flow
  - User enters a number, selects an operator, enters another number, and presses equals.
  - The app updates the display with the current value and, when appropriate, the computed result.
- Chaining operations
  - Users can perform a sequence of operations by pressing operators after a result is shown.
  - The calculator can manage a simple history or reuse the current result as the starting point for the next operation.
- Decimal handling
  - The input mechanism should support decimal points and prevent multiple decimals in a single number.
  - The logic should ensure correct display formatting and calculation results.

Screens and visuals
- UI screenshots
  - You can include reference images in the documentation to illustrate the layout and responsiveness.
  - If you provide images in the repository, reference their paths in the README for clarity.
- Design notes
  - The UI should be intuitive for beginners.
  - The keypad should be large enough to tap accurately on touch devices.

Longer-form usage guide
- Step-by-step walk-through
  - Step 1: Open the app and observe the display at the top.
  - Step 2: Press a digit to begin a number entry.
  - Step 3: Press an operator to store the first value.
  - Step 4: Enter the second number and press equals to see the result.
  - Step 5: Use Clear or Delete to reset or correct mistakes.
- Troubleshooting during the walkthrough
  - If the display does not update, check the event listeners and ensure the buttons emit the correct events.
